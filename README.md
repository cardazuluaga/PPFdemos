# Probabilistic Power flow demos
Here, we present demos to analyze probabilistic power flow problems.

This Demo includes several methods for addressing the Probabilistic power flow
problem (PPF). We employ the Monte Carlo simulation method and different 
approximate Bayesian computation methods. This code is based in the following 
document:

Zuluaga C.D., √Ålvarez M.A. (2017) Approximate Probabilistic Power Flow.

Renewable Energy Integration. DARE 2016. Lecture Notes in Computer 
Science, vol 10097.
